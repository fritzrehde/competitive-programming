        Approach:  Brute force.
        Idea:      Maintain two hashmaps mapping sock id to wear score, one for while awake and one for while sleeping. Upon awaking, print those id's that have a different score from before sleeping.
        Time:      O(n): Given n events, in the worst case, our solution essentially has two O(n) passes: first, each event mutates the count of one id (O(1)). Then, each wake causes at most m updates (O(m)), where the sum of all m is n.
        Space:     O(n): Given n events, at most n different sock ids can have counts, so our hashmaps both have a max size of n.
