# My Solutions to Competitive Programming Problems

This repository contains my Python solutions to competitive programming problems from various online platforms.

**Why use Python?**
I think Python is a good language for quickly writing elegant and readable programs.
Of course, performance will be compromised, but performance is not the main goal of this project for now.
I am mostly solving these puzzles to improve my knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures.

Each of my problem solutions contains several (differently performing) implementations, as well as time and space complexity explanations.
