# My [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions

**Why use Python?**
I think Python is a good language for quickly writing elegant and readable programs.
Of course, performance will be compromised, but performance is not the main goal of this project for now.
I am mostly solving these puzzles to improve my knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures.

You can find the difficulty and description of the problems, as well as a link to the Python files, which contain a description of the problem and several (differently performing) implementations for each problem, in the table below.
The problems are sorted by category.
