# My LeetCode solutions

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is an online platform with hundreds of programming problems to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical conding interviews.
This repository contains some of my solutions to the problems in Python.

**Why use Python?**
I think Python is a good language for quickly writing elegant and readable programs.
Of course, performance will be compromised, but performance is not the main goal of this project for now.
I am mostly solving these puzzles to improve my knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures.

You can find the difficulty and description of the problems, as well as a link to the Python files, which contain a description of the problem and several (differently performing) implementations for each problem, in the table below.
The problems are sorted by category.

## Array

| # | Difficulty | Problem Title | Implementation |
|:--|:-----------|:--------------|:---------------|
| 1 | Easy | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [Python](./python/two-sum/two_sum.py) |
